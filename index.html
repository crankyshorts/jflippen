            Hey there, I'm Jesse Flippen! <img src="./profile%20pic.jpg" width="60px"/>
          </h1>
          <p>
üëã I'm a passionate software developer with a knack for turning coffee into code.<br/> Whether it‚Äôs building elegant web applications, wrangling data, or automating everyday tasks, I thrive on solving problems and creating meaningful solutions.
<br/>My journey into the world of tech started in a slightly unconventional way. As a former sales professional, I discovered my love for Python and SQL during late-night coding sessions (yes, fueled by copious amounts of caffeine). The logic puzzles and the thrill of seeing my code come to life quickly became addictive. Fast forward to today, and I‚Äôm on a mission to blend my business acumen with my newfound technical skills.

<br/>What Fires Me Up
APIs and Integrations: I‚Äôm fascinated by the interconnectedness of systems. APIs are like magical bridges that allow different applications to talk to each other.<br/> Whether it‚Äôs RESTful APIs, GraphQL, or even WebSockets, I‚Äôm all ears (and endpoints).
GitHub Explorer: While my GitHub account might not have as many stars as the night sky, I‚Äôm committed to changing that.<br/> You‚Äôll find my repositories filled with experiments, side projects, and the occasional ‚ÄúWhy did I think this was a good idea?‚Äù commit. But hey, learning is messy, right?
Clean Code Evangelist: I believe that well-organized code is poetry for machines.<br/> I‚Äôm constantly refining my craft, learning design patterns, and ensuring my codebase is as elegant as a well-tailored suit.<br/>
What I Bring to the Table<br/><br/>
Pythonic Wizardry: Python is my trusty wand. From data manipulation to building APIs, I wield it with finesse. And yes, I‚Äôve even dabbled in a bit of Flask and Django magic.
<br/>SQL Sorcery: SELECT, JOIN, WHERE‚Äîthese are my incantations.<br/> I‚Äôve danced with databases, optimized queries, and made data sing. If you need help taming your data dragons, I‚Äôm your SQL mage.
<br/>Learning Alchemist: Curiosity fuels my learning journey.<br/> Whether it‚Äôs a new framework, a language, or a quirky algorithm, I‚Äôm always up for a challenge. <br/>Learning isn‚Äôt a sprint; it‚Äôs a marathon with a side of debugging.
Let‚Äôs Connect!<br/><br/>
Enough about me‚Äîlet‚Äôs talk about you!<br/> Whether you‚Äôre a fellow developer, a hiring manager, or just someone who appreciates a good tech meme, I‚Äôd love to connect.<br/> Reach out via LinkedIn, Twitter, or carrier pigeon (okay, maybe not the last one).
<br/>
Feel free to personalize this template further by adding anecdotes, humor, or any other details that make you uniquely you. And remember, your ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù section is your digital handshake‚Äîmake it memorable! üöÄ‚ú®
<br/><br/>
P.S. If you find any bugs in my code, just pretend they‚Äôre features. üòÑ
